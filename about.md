## Projects

### Project 1: Traffic Analysis

Using Python and the pandas and numpy packages I analyzed the data. Then I used the Matplotlib and Seaborn packages to visualize the data in a graph. We did this to look at the data in a much easier and simpler way to understand. Throughout this project I learned how to create graphs in python as well as how to sort through data.

### Project 2: Risk Analysis of Colorado and Idaho

A short description of this project. What problem did it solve? What did you learn?
In this project I used python using pandas and numpy packages to analyze and sort the data. Then I created my own risk analysis function to calculate the amount of risk for a certain natural disaster in each state and compared them against each other. This was done to compare the two states risks for certain natural disasters. From this project I learned how to sort large datasets and pick out the information that is more important and useful.
